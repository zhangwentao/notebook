## what is Router

for frontend and backend program, Router can be described, input a string like path(or indentifier), the program will execute some dedicate service(or function) or display some dedicate UI modules.
Briefly, the progress is , you describe what you want , the router will give what you want.

## what is nested Routes
make an analogy, nested Routes is like the catelog of a book,that is a nested structure.The logical nested structure is benifitful for searching what you want.



# Philosophy

## Static Routing
declare routes as part of your appâ€™s initialization before any rendering takes place.
React Router also followed that lead up until v4.

## Dynamic Routing
When we say dynamic routing, we mean routing that takes place as your app is rendering, not in a configuration or convention outside of a running app.
